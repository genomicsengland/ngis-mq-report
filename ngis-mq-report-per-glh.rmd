```{r, test fail counts per GLH, echo = FALSE}

kable(table(tr$test_id[!tr$test_result & tr$glh %in% glh],
			tr$glh[!tr$test_result & tr$glh %in% glh]))

```

## Test failure report

The following table provides details of all GMS data quality test failures.

```{r, test fails report per GLH, echo = FALSE}

kable(tr[!tr$test_result & tr$glh %in% glh,])

```
