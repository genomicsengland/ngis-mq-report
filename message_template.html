<p>Please see attached the latest DQ report output for ${GLH_NAME} GLH. Please refer to the <a href="https://public.huddle.com/a/NJWMEEe/index.html">DQ Report Guidance</a> which gives a brief explanation on how to resolve each issue.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about anything in the report please do contact Genomics England via the Service Desk using the link above. We will endeavour to respond back to you as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please be aware we are currently in the BETA testing phase. As part of BETA testing Genomics England may have submitted test orders from clinics that form part of your GLH. As a result you may see output in the DQ report which you have not entered – please ignore these rows. It is advisable to keep a note of the referral IDs of the test orders you have submitted and then filter the report for these rows.</p>
<p>Please also note the DQ report is currently under testing and therefore not all of the rules are being applied to the report. During the BETA phase more rules will be added to the DQ report as they pass testing. The current list of rules being applied can be seen in the ‘All rules’ tab in the DQ report. The DQ report testing aims to be finished before the BETA dry runs begin. Before the dry runs begin the most recent version of the DQ report template will be circulated to NSHE and GLH. At this point the document will be version controlled and will follow the standardised document release procedure for each subsequent update.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>The Data Quality Team,<br>
Genomics England.</p>
