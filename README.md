# NGIS MQ Reports

This script produces nice spreadsheets showing the latest results from the NGIS MQ.

There is a dependancy on `openxlsx` to make the spreadsheets. This can only be installed on newer versions of R. To have this run on query it's advisable to install a separate instance of R. [This GitHub project](https://github.com/DominikMueller64/install_R_source) allows you to do this. Once installed then you'll need to install `wrangleR`, `openxlsx` and `RPostgreSQL` and all their dependencies into that new version of R.

Details on how to install the latest version of wrangleR are [available on Confluence](https://cnfl.extge.co.uk/display/CDT/Code+Snippets#CodeSnippets-BuildnewversionofwrangleR).
